The aim is to build a regression model that predicts taxi cab fares before each ride based on distance, time of day, and any additional variables.

My task, please draft a plan of action for the team. Include questions we need to answer before we get started on the project, important details to consider at the beginning of the project,
and action items we'll need throughout the duration of the project.
